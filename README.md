# LostGPT

A simple Full Stack chat application built using React, Python, Flask, and OpenAI Api demonstrate how to create a Chatbot using AI and Machine Learning.

## Overview

This project consists of a frontend built with React and a backend built with Python and Flask. The frontend sends user messages to the backend, which processes them using the Curie GPT model to generate appropriate responses. The frontend then displays the conversation between the user and the AI-powered chatbot.
